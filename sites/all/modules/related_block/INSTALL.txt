INSTALLATION
------------

Decompress the related_block-n.x-n.n.tar.gz file into your Drupal modules
directory (usually sites/all/modules, see http://drupal.org/node/176044 for
more information).

Enable the related_block module: Administer > Site building > Modules
  (admin/build/modules)

Enable the "similar block" block: Administer > Site Building > Blocks 
  (admin/build/block)

Configure the block: admin/build/configure/related_block/0


NOTE: This module relies on the search_index table being fully populated, which
typically requires a working cron job setup to function properly. See:
http://drupal.org/getting-started/6/install/cron for more details on setting up
your site's cron job.
