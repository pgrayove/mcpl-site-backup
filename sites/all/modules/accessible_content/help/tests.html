<p>Tests are single tests for accessibility that are provided by the QUAIL library. QUAIL supports all tests outlined by the <a href="http://www.atutor.ca/achecker/oac.php">Open Accessibility Tests</a> standards; however, you can also write your own.</p>

<p>The Accessible Content module adds all the supported tests as a node to your Durpal site, so it is easy to edit their titles and descriptions. Site administrators might want to change the body of their tests so that when an author finds a problem, the test will tell them how to fix the issue in a way that is particular to their site.</p>

<h3>Severity Levels</h3>
<p>Tests also have <em>severity levels</em> which break down to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Severe</strong> Quail is 100% certain that this is an error.</li>
	<li><strong>Moderate</strong> Quail has found a potential error that requires human interpretation.</li>
	<li><strong>Suggestion</strong> These are errors which might point to tips regarding language usage or the flow of a document that requires human interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Site administrators can change the severity level of any test; however, it is suggest that the default level be chosen.</p>
<h3>Writing Custom Tests</h3>
You can write your own custom tests for QUAIL by following the Wiki page guidelines at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/quail-lib/wiki/writingCustomTests">QUAIL Project Site</a>.
